# Bharat Monitor 🇳🟳

**Real-time continental intelligence dashboard** — Geopolitical monitoring, financial telemetry, and military tracking in a unified, modular situational awareness interface entirely hyper-focused on India & South Asia.

*This project is absolutely sending us and it's giving big main character energy fr fr no cap 💯✨*

## Why Bharat Monitor? (Bestie, let us explain) 🙏

| Problem (The Struggle) | Solution (The Glow Up) |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| Information overload & ugly dashboards 🤢 | **Clean, VS Code-style modular dashboard** where every panel can be toggled on/off (it's giving aesthetic vibes). |
| No geospatial context for events 🗺️ | **Interactive high-performance Canvas map** with 34 toggleable data layers specifically tailored for the subcontinent (geography queen behavior). |
| Clunky global trackers 🐢 | **22 custom trackers** focused on India (we said what we said - local > global). |
| Static news feeds 😴 | **Real-time updates** via Rust WebSocket layers streaming financial telemetry at 1Hz frames (this data hits different). |
| Expensive OSINT tools (💸💸💸) | **100% free & open source** (because paying for OSINT is giving broke energy). |
| You get hacked 💀 | We have an easter egg terminal that literally runs `curl rate.sx` inside the browser without exploding (trust the process bestie). |

## The Stack

A full-stack geospatial intelligence platform for India across three distinct polyglot services:

| Service | Stack | Port | Status |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| `bharat-ai` | Python 3 FastAPI + Uvicorn | 8000 | ✅ Operational |
| `bharat-core` | Rust Axum + Tokio | 8080 | ✅ High-performance telemetry |
| `bharat-ui` | Next.js 14 + Tailwind | 3000 | ✅ Live |

## Dashboard Interface

### Clean Default State & Modular Telemetry

The UI was meticulously softened to achieve a professional "hackathon winner" aesthetic. Harsh neon Hex codes were replaced with muted pastels, ping animations slowed to 4-second breaths, and a strict VS Code-style panel architecture was introduced. 

![Clean Default Map State](./brain/b42653f7-faf8-49e1-ae7b-4d82351f2054/clean_map_state_1773578137867.png)

### Expanded Geospatial Intelligence Trackers

Bharat Monitor brings **34 geospatial tracker layers**, carefully categorized into 8 distinct intelligence groups:
1. **Geopolitical:** War Zones (India vs Conflict Borders), LoC/LAC.
2. **Cities & Education:** Tech hubs, Finance centers, Student Protests.
3. **Military & Defense:** Strategic Radii, Navy Bases, Base perimeters.
4. **Intelligence & Cyber:** Cyber Threats, Data Centers.
5. **Transport & Infrastructure:** Space Ports, NH Corridors, Railway Lines.
6. **Maritime & Pipelines:** Major Ports, Overland/Undersea Pipelines.
7. **Natural & Environment:** Natural Events, Monsoons, Weather Alerts.
8. **Policy & Research:** Think Tanks, Innovation Centers.

## Core Panels

### 📊 Financial Telemetry
- Live **SENSEX**, **NIFTY50**, **BANKNIFTY** updating seamlessly.
- **Power Grid Status** — Load % bars with saturation probability per region (Western, Northern, Southern, Eastern).
- **Highway Congestion** — Live speed indicators for central corridors.

### 📡 Live Intel Feed
- Scrolling alert cards color-coded by severity (CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO).
- Integrated with right-anchor activity bar for collapsible reading.

### 🇮🇳 Country Intel Panel
- Instability Index (Stable / Elevated / Critical).
- Threat vector breakdowns across Security, Conflict, and Cyber domains.
- Top news feeds and military activity counters.

### 💻 Virtual Terminal
- A dark-mode macOS virtual terminal expanding from the right edge.
- Live execution of `curl rate.sx` directly in the browser!

## Responsive Power-User Features

* **Tailored Resizability**: The Left and Right activity panels are interactively draggable bounding between 200px and 800px to expand telemetry charts.
* **Mobile-First Modals**: The workspace strictly switches to `absolute` floating popups when viewed on a phone, keeping the map fully functional with pinch-to-zoom Canvas rendering.

## How to Run (It's giving easy mode 🎮)

```bash
# Full stack (Starts UI, Rust Backend & Python AI layer) - the whole squad 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
bash ./start.sh

# Frontend only (works standalone with simulation fallback) - just the pretty face
cd bharat-ui
npm install && npm run dev
```

*Note: This setup is so smooth it's giving buttery vibes bestie 🧈✨*
